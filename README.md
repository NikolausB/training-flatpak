## Multi-Round Circuits

Training plans support multiple rounds. Set "Total Rounds" in the plan editor to repeat all exercises multiple times. You can also configure "Rest Between Rounds" — a pause between rounds with a countdown timer and sound indicators.

The HIIT Cardio Blast default plan uses 3 rounds with 30 seconds rest between each round.

## AI Coach

The AI Coach tab (hidden by default, enable in Preferences) lets you generate training plans using:

- **Ollama** (local) — Run LLMs locally with zero API key required
- **OpenAI-compatible** — Any provider with an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint

Generated plans are automatically matched against the built-in exercise database for images, and can be saved directly to your training plans.
